Here is a list of continuous delivery / DevOps tools that I have compiled that can be used to help 
automate the provisioning and deployment of software onto GNU/Linux servers (Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, etc ...) :

Keep in mind that this list is rapidly evolving and will need to be reviewed at least once a year.


Continuous Delivery Toolchain in the Enterprise (rapidly evolving)

======================================================

main types of management tools:
step 1) image generation (optional): boxgrinder, bitnami, Suse Studio, m23
step 2) bootstrapping (optional): openstack, cloudstack, ubuntu server
step 3) provisioning : Amazon AWS CloudFormation, openqrm (support for high-availability), seedBank (tool @github for proxmox), crowbar (tool @github for openstack), cobbler, foreman, maas, juju, razor, vagrant, docker, Packer, VeeWee, ansible, Salt Cloud, m23, Spacewalk, IBM速 UrbanCode Deploy
step 4) release Management + automation
               4.1 Repository: pulp (yum repos), yum s3 plugin, artifactory, archiva
               4.2 Artifact: Sonatype Nexus, eggs, gems, perlmod, rpm, deb, jar, war, ear, IBM速 UrbanCode Deploy
               4.3 Build: ant, jenkins (formally known as hudson; can manage pulp, git,rpm  and deployment lifecycle), maven, make, gradle (combines power of ant+maven)
               4.4 SCM: git (can manage puppet manifests and modules), github, svn, cvs, hg, Perforce
               4.5 Tracker: glpi (can integrate with nagios), bugzilla, mantis, trac
step 5) configuration management: openqrm,ansible, foreman (can be data backend for puppet), puppet, geppetto, facter, hiera, chef solo, cfengine, ncf, saltstack, Spacewalk, RANCID, Fabric (python), IBM速 UrbanCode Deploy
step 6) orchestration/start-stop services: openqrm, foreman, capistrano, rundeck, fabric, func, mcollective, salt, ansible, IBM速 UrbanCode Deploy
step 7) monitoring, control and runbook automation
               7.1 monitoring: openqrm, icinga, foreman, nagios (works well with puppet 3.0), zenoss, cacti
               7.2 runbook automation: controltier, jobscheduler, openscheduler
               7.3 Command line automation tools: cron, perl, python, bash/korn shell, rerun (@github), expect (interactive CLI automation)
               7.4 resilience test tool: Netflix / SimianArmy (@github)
               7.5 metrics/graphing/dashboards: StatsD+Graphite, Splunk, Grafana, New Relic, AppDynamics
               7.6 logging: Logstash, Kibana, ElasticSearch, Splunk
